# Privacy Policy for Roku Express Remote

**Effective Date:** July 26, 2024

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Roku Express Remote ("the App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices about that information. Our guiding principle is to collect only the minimum information necessary to make the App functional and to be transparent about our practices.

## 2. Information We Collect and Use

The App is designed to function without collecting any of your personally identifiable information. The information we handle is purely technical and is limited to the scope of your local Wi-Fi network.

### a) Local Network Information

*   **What we collect:** To discover your Roku device, the App uses the Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) to scan your local Wi-Fi network. During this scan, the App identifies the local IP addresses of devices on your network to find compatible Roku players.
*   **How we use it:** This information is used **exclusively** to display a list of available Roku devices for you to connect to. This network data is processed in real-time and is **not** stored permanently or transmitted outside of your local network.

### b) Selected Roku Device Information

*   **What we collect:** Once you select a Roku device from the discovered list, we save its local IP address on your mobile device's internal storage using `shared_preferences`.
*   **How we use it:** This is done solely for your convenience. Storing the IP address allows the App to reconnect to your Roku device automatically the next time you open it, saving you from having to scan the network again. This information is stored **only on your device** and is never transmitted to us or any third party.

### c) No Personally Identifiable Information

We do **not** collect, access, store, or transmit any personal information. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Your name, email address, or phone number.
*   Your geographic location.
*   Your contacts, photos, or other files on your device.
*   Any usage analytics or crash reporting that could identify you.

The App does not require you to create an account.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

The limited technical information we collect is used strictly to provide the core functionality of the App, which includes:

*   **Discovering** and listing available Roku devices on your local network.
*   **Connecting** to your selected Roku device.
*   **Sending remote control commands** (e.g., navigation, play/pause, volume changes) from your phone to your Roku device.
*   **Querying and launching** applications (channels) installed on your Roku device.

All of this communication happens directly between your phone and your Roku device over your local Wi-Fi network.

## 4. Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do **not** share, sell, rent, or trade any user information with any third parties because we do not collect any personal information in the first place. All data required for the App to function remains within your local network.

## 5. Data Security

We take the security of your information seriously. The only piece of data we store—the local IP address of your Roku device—is kept in your device's private, sandboxed storage, which is protected by the security mechanisms of the Android operating system. It cannot be accessed by other apps on your device.

## 6. Children's Privacy

The App is intended for a general audience and does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us so we can delete it.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our website. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes are effective when they are posted.
